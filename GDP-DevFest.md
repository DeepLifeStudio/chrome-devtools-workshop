Google Developer Groups & DevFest
Connecting developers through community-led events worldwide

What are Google Developer Groups?
Google Developer Groups (GDGs) are local communities of developers who come together to learn, share, and connect around Google technologies. These groups organize regular meetups, workshops, and events to help developers build solutions and grow their skills.

GDGs are not affiliated with Google but are developer-led groups passionate about technology and helping others succeed in their development journey. They provide a platform for developers to network, collaborate, and learn from each other.
